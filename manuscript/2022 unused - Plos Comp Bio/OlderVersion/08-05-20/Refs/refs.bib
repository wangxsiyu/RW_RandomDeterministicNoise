abstract = {Computational modeling of behavior has revolutionized psychology and neuroscience. By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

abstract = {The dilemma between information gathering (exploration) and reward seeking (exploitation) is a fundamental problem for reinforcement learning agents. How humans resolve this dilemma is still an open question, because experiments have provided equivocal evidence about the underlying algorithms used by humans. We show that two families of algorithms can be distinguished in terms of how uncertainty affects exploration. Algorithms based on uncertainty bonuses predict a change in response bias as a function of uncertainty, whereas algorithms based on sampling predict a change in response slope. Two experiments provide evidence for both bias and slope changes, and computational modeling confirms that a hybrid model is the best quantitative account of the data.},

	abstract = {Integrating evidence over time is crucial for effective decision making. For simple perceptual decisions, a large body of work suggests that humans and animals are capable of integrating evidence over time fairly well, but that their performance is far from optimal. This suboptimality is thought to arise from a number of different sources including (1) noise in sensory and motor systems, (2) unequal weighting of evidence over time, (3) order effects from previous trials and (4) irrational side biases for one choice over another. In this work we investigated whether and how these different sources of suboptimality are related to pupil dilation, a putative correlate of norepinephrine tone. In particular, we measured pupil response in humans making a series of decisions based on rapidly-presented auditory information in an evidence accumulation task. We found that people exhibited all four types of suboptimality, but that only noise and the uneven weighting of evidence over time, the {\textquoteright}integration kernel{\textquoteright}, were related to the change in pupil response during the stimulus. Moreover, these two different suboptimalities were related to different aspects of the pupil signal, with the individual differences in pupil response associated with individual differences in integration kernel, while trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil response were associated with trial-by-trial fluctuations in noise. These results suggest that different sources of suboptimality in human perceptual decision making are related to distinct pupil-linked processes possibly related to tonic and phasic norepinephrine activity.},

	abstract = {The adaptive regulation of the trade-off between pursuing a known reward (exploitation) and sampling lesser-known options in search of something better (exploration) is critical for optimal performance. Theory and recent empirical work suggest that humans use at least two strategies for solving this dilemma: a directed strategy in which choices are explicitly biased toward information seeking, and a random strategy in which decision noise leads to exploration by chance. Here we examined the hypothesis that random exploration is governed by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We administered atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker that increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine throughout the cortex, to 22 healthy human participants in a double-blind crossover design. We examined the effect of treatment on performance in a gambling task designed to produce distinct measures of directed exploration and random exploration. In line with our hypothesis we found an effect of atomoxetine on random, but not directed exploration. However, contrary to expectation, atomoxetine reduced rather than increased random exploration. We offer three potential explanations of our findings, involving the non-linear relationship between tonic NE and cognitive performance, the interaction of atomoxetine with other neuromodulators, and the possibility that atomoxetine affected phasic norepinephrine activity more so than tonic norepinephrine activity.},
