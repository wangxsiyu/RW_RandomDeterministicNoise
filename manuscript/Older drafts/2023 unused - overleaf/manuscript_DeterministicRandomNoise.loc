In this case, we model participants' choices on the first free-choice trial by assuming they make decisions by computing the difference in value (or utility) $\Delta Q$ between the right and left options, choosing right when $\Delta Q > 0$ and left otherwise. Specifically, we write \begin {equation} \Delta Q= \Delta R+A \Delta I+b+n \end {equation} where, the experimentally controlled variables are $\Delta R=R_{right}-R_{left}$, the difference between the mean of rewards shown on the forced trials, and $\Delta I$, the difference in information available for playing the two options on the first free-choice trial. For simplicity, and because information is manipulated categorically in the Horizon Task, we define $\Delta I$ to be +1 if one reward is drawn from the right option and three are drawn from the left in the [1 3] condition, -1 if one from the left and three from the right, and in [2 2] condition, $\Delta I$ is 0. $n_{det}$ denotes the deterministic noise, which is identical on the repeat versions of each game; and $n$ denotes decision noise, which, in this version of the model is a combination of deterministic and random noise. $n$ is assumed to come from a logistic distributions with mean 0 and standard deviations $\sigma $. }}{8}{section*.40}%

In the coverage analysis, we simulated choices with the fitted parameters from the Hierarchical Bayesian analysis, and then re-fit the simulated choices to see whether we can recover the parameters (Figure \ref {fig:coverage2}, Supplementary Figure S4). The simulation and re-fitting was repeated for 200 times. Then we counted out of the 200 repetitions how many times the true parameter that we simulate the choices from lies in the fitted 95\% confidence interval. If our model fitting is reliable, then the fitted confidence interval should cover the true parameter for more than 95\% of the simulations (this ratio will be referred to as the coverage rate). For random noise, the coverage rate is 100\% for both horizon 1, horizon 6, and the horizon difference. For deterministic noise, the coverage rate is 66\% for horizon 1 and 69\% for horizon 6. By comparing the posterior distributions of parameters that were used to generate simulations and the posterior distribution of recovered parameters, it is clear that our model systematically underestimates deterministic noise (Figure \ref {fig:coverage2}). Despite the underestimation of deterministic noise in both horizons, we could still reliably detect the horizon changes of deterministic noise (coverage rate is 97\%). This is because the underestimation of deterministic noise is partially canceled out when the difference is taken between horizons. For random noise, our model fitting procedure yields a faithful recovery. However, there is a conceptual limitation. Because random noise is modeled as non-stimulus-driven noise, it can include both true stochastic neural noise and possible deterministic noises which do not depend on the stimuli. Because of this, our random noise estimate provides an upper bound of true `random noise' induced by intrinsic stochastic processes in the brain.}}{18}{section*.68}%

In a special case, we evaluated how our model performs when there is only random noise or only deterministic noise (Figure \ref {fig:puredetran}). In the simulation with fully deterministic noise and 0 random noise, our model successfully recovered both random and deterministic noise (Figure \ref {fig:puredetran} C, D), however in the simulation with fully random noise and 0 deterministic noise, although our model successfully recovered random noise, some small proportion of deterministic noise was falsely detected when they should instead be 0 (Figure \ref {fig:puredetran} A, B). However, this phenomenon only exists when the true deterministic noise is 0, once the true deterministic noise is greater than 1, we don't observe this inflation of deterministic noise anymore (Supplementary Figures S7).

Such a random noise interpretation, would be consistent with recent work showing that variability in perceptual decisions may be driven by imperfections in mental inference \cite {drugowitsch16}. In this view, apparently random behavior is not due to sensory processing or response selection, but to suboptimal computations in the brain. Although suboptimal inference is different from simply adding random noise to neural circuitry\citep {Pouget12}, as long as the suboptimality in neural computation is not a deterministic function of the stimuli, it is a form of random noise in our definition. Indeed, a strong interpretation of this hypothesis would suggest that randomness in explore-exploit behavior is due to imperfect inference about the correct course of action. In the context of the Horizon Task, such computational errors would likely be larger in the long horizon condition as the correct course of action in these cases is much harder to compute CITE DEEP EXPLORATION PAPER.}}{28}{section*.94}%
