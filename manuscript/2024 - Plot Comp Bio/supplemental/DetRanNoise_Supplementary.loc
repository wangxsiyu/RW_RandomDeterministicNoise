\contentsline {added}{Added\nobreakspace {}(siyu): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ Moreover, we examined if our model can indeed qualitatively capture whether deterministic and random noise are present or not and whether either types of noise is dependent on horizon. To test this, we simulated choices from each of the 6 models, and then fit the simulated choices with our original full model. The simulation was repeated 50 times for each model. Indeed, we showed that our model can capture both the existence of random and deterministic noise, and whether each noise changes with horizon condition (Figure \ref {fig:6model}), with only one exception that our model falsely detected a small fraction of deterministic noise when no deterministic noise was present (Figure \ref {fig:6model}, S). This phenomenon was also examined and discussed in the section "Model validation" above. }}{19}{section*.17}%
