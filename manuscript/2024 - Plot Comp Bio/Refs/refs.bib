abstract = {How reliably do action potentials in cortical neurons encode information about a visual stimulus? Most physiological studies do not weigh the occurrences of particular action potentials as significant but treat them only as reflections of average neuronal excitation. We report that single neurons recorded in a previous study by Newsome et al. (1989; see also Britten et al. 1992) from cortical area MT in the behaving monkey respond to dynamic and unpredictable motion stimuli with a markedly reproducible temporal modulation that is precise to a few milliseconds. This temporal modulation is stimulus dependent, being present for highly dynamic random motion but absent when the stimulus translates rigidly.},

abstract = {Computational modeling of behavior has revolutionized psychology and neuroscience. By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

How humans resolve this dilemma is still an open question, because experiments have provided equivocal evidence about the underlying algorithms used by humans. We show that two families of algorithms can be distinguished in terms of how uncertainty affects exploration. Algorithms based on uncertainty bonuses predict a change in response bias as a function of uncertainty, whereas algorithms based on sampling predict a change in response slope. Two experiments provide evidence for both bias and slope changes, and computational modeling confirms that a hybrid model is the best quantitative account of the data.},

	abstract = {Integrating evidence over time is crucial for effective decision making. For simple perceptual decisions, a large body of work suggests that humans and animals are capable of integrating evidence over time fairly well, but that their performance is far from optimal. This suboptimality is thought to arise from a number of different sources including (1) noise in sensory and motor systems, (2) unequal weighting of evidence over time, (3) order effects from previous trials and (4) irrational side biases for one choice over another. In this work we investigated whether and how these different sources of suboptimality are related to pupil dilation, a putative correlate of norepinephrine tone. In particular, we measured pupil response in humans making a series of decisions based on rapidly-presented auditory information in an evidence accumulation task. We found that people exhibited all four types of suboptimality, but that only noise and the uneven weighting of evidence over time, the {\textquoteright}integration kernel{\textquoteright}, were related to the change in pupil response during the stimulus. Moreover, these two different suboptimalities were related to different aspects of the pupil signal, with the individual differences in pupil response associated with individual differences in integration kernel, while trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil response were associated with trial-by-trial fluctuations in noise. These results suggest that different sources of suboptimality in human perceptual decision making are related to distinct pupil-linked processes possibly related to tonic and phasic norepinephrine activity.},

Theory and recent empirical work suggest that humans use at least two strategies for solving this dilemma: a directed strategy in which choices are explicitly biased toward information seeking, and a random strategy in which decision noise leads to exploration by chance. Here we examined the hypothesis that random exploration is governed by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We administered atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker that increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine throughout the cortex, to 22 healthy human participants in a double-blind crossover design. We examined the effect of treatment on performance in a gambling task designed to produce distinct measures of directed exploration and random exploration. In line with our hypothesis we found an effect of atomoxetine on random, but not directed exploration. However, contrary to expectation, atomoxetine reduced rather than increased random exploration. We offer three potential explanations of our findings, involving the non-linear relationship between tonic NE and cognitive performance, the interaction of atomoxetine with other neuromodulators, and the possibility that atomoxetine affected phasic norepinephrine activity more so than tonic norepinephrine activity.},

Humans are also able to exploit sophisticated structural knowledge to aid their exploration, such as information about correlations between options. New computational models, drawing inspiration from machine learning, have begun to formalize these ideas and offer new ways to understand the neural basis of reinforcement learning.}

Such decisions are ubiquitous in nature, but from a computational perspective, they are notoriously hard. There is therefore much interest in how humans and animals make these decisions and recently there has been an explosion of research in this area. Here we provide a biased and incomplete snapshot of this field focusing on the major finding that many organisms use two distinct strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: a bias for information (‘directed exploration’) and the randomization of choice (‘random exploration’). We review evidence for the existence of these strategies, their computational properties, their neural implementations, as well as how directed and random exploration vary over the lifespan. We conclude by highlighting open questions in this field that are ripe to both explore and exploit.}

	abstract = {When experts are immersed in a task, do their brains prioritize task-related activity? Most efforts to understand neural activity during well-learned tasks focus on cognitive computations and task-related movements. We wondered whether task-performing animals explore a broader movement landscape and how this impacts neural activity. We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and two-photon imaging. Cortex-wide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements not required for the task. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trial-averaged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trial-by-trial fluctuations that are often considered 'noise'. This held true throughout task-learning and for extracellular Neuropixels recordings that included subcortical areas. Our observations argue that animals execute expert decisions while performing richly varied, uninstructed movements that profoundly shape neural activity.},

	abstract = {Neuronal activity in sensory cortex fluctuates over time and across repetitions of the same input. This variability is often considered detrimental to neural coding. The theory of neural sampling proposes instead that variability encodes the uncertainty of perceptual inferences. In primary visual cortex (V1), modulation of variability by sensory and non-sensory factors supports this view. However, it is unknown whether V1 variability reflects the statistical structure of visual inputs, as would be required for inferences correctly tuned to the statistics of the natural environment. Here we combine analysis of image statistics and recordings in macaque V1 to show that probabilistic inference tuned to natural image statistics explains the widely observed dependence between spike count variance and mean, and the modulation of V1 activity and variability by spatial context in images. Our results show that the properties of a basic aspect of cortical responses-their variability-can be explained by a probabilistic representation tuned to naturalistic inputs.},

	abstract = {Behavior varies from trial to trial even when the stimulus is maintained as constant as possible. In many models, this variability is attributed to noise in the brain. Here, we propose that there is another major source of variability: suboptimal inference. Importantly, we argue that in most tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side, and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable.},

   abstract = {When learning the value of actions in volatile environments, humans often make seemingly irrational decisions that fail to maximize expected value. We reasoned that these 'non-greedy' decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here using reinforcement learning models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stem from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by blood oxygen level-dependent responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and by phasic pupillary dilation, suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Together, these findings indicate that most behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits construct distributed representations of key variables-external stimuli or internal constructs of quantities relevant for survival, such as an estimate of one's location in the world-as vectors of population activity. Although population activity vectors may have thousands of entries (dimensions), we consider that they trace out a low-dimensional manifold whose dimension and topology match the represented variable. This manifold perspective enables blind discovery and decoding of the represented variable using only neural population activity (without knowledge of the input, output, behavior or topography). We characterize and directly visualize manifold structure in the mammalian head direction circuit, revealing that the states form a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring exhibits isometry and is invariant across waking and rapid eye movement sleep. This result directly demonstrates that there are continuous attractor dynamics and enables powerful inference about mechanism. Finally, external rather than internal noise limits memory fidelity, and the manifold approach reveals new dynamical trajectories during sleep.},
