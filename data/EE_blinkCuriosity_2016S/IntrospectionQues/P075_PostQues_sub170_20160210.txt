PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

****************************************************************************************

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I think the experiment was about how your eyes move when making decisions agains the odds that were presented when choosing between which lever to use so that you had the greater number of points in the end. It was really easy and fast, pretty simple too. 2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  It was pretty easy when I saw a pattern of higher numbers on one side vs. the other. 3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? I didn’t really have a strategy besides when there were higher numbers on one side to go with that number.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games?

For longer games it was easier to see which side had the higher numbers and it was easier to choose. For the shorter games it was sometimes a toss up since there wasn’t too much information given to decide which side to choose.  4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?

No.5. Were you distracted at all during the task?Not too much, except when the other people around me where finishing and typing I was wondering what they were doing.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?

I had some coffee with creamer around 11:007. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?

I do not play video games.******************************************************************************************
