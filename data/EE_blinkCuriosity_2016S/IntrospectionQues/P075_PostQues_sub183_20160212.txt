PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

****************************************************************************************

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I think the experiment was about using past experiences to judge new situations, such as creating a type of pattern from a previous trial and applying it to the next one. I often felt as if there were some observable patterns throughout the game. Whether that was an accurate assumption or not is a different story.2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  I thought the task was difficult at times depending on the block. I thought it became easier over time though. 3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? 

I tried to continue selecting the same bandit when a rather large or rather small number came up.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games? I followed my strategy more strictly when the games were longer. I often switched between the two bandits in the shorter games.4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?No5. Were you distracted at all during the task?

Briefly when the other participants left the room.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?

I have not had any caffeine recently.7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?

Yes. Sports and first person shooting games. About once every two-three weeks.******************************************************************************************
