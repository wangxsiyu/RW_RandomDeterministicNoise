PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

****************************************************************************************

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I was informed that the experiment was about decision making and monitoring eye movement.  I thought the experiment was fairly straight forward, not very complicated.2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  I was told the test would take anywhere from 20-40 minutes and was able to complete it fairly quickly.  I feel it wasn’t too difficult3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? I would pick the side that seemed to have the larger numbers in general.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games? For longer games I would start by picking the side that had the bigger numbers. At some point I would switch to the other side to see if the numbers were any larger, if they weren’t then I went back to the original side, and if they were then I continued on that side until the numbers got smaller again.  For shorter games I just stuck with the side that had the larger numbers and if a smaller number appeared I switched to the other side hoping there was a bigger number.4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?I felt awake the whole time, however after staring at a computer screen for a while I felt that sometimes I randomly chose a side because I lost focus for a minute.5. Were you distracted at all during the task?Although there was talking and what seemed like clicking going on I felt fairly focused the whole time.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?No.7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?No.******************************************************************************************
