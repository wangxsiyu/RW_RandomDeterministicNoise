1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?Well when it said gambling task on the sit I thought it was going to be about probability and it was. 2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  It was fairly easy and at my own pace so it was easy to pick and choose.3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? I would choose the blocks depending on the numbers that were at the beginning of the set and just choose from there.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games?Yes the ones with the longer trials I thought about which side to choose rather than the shorter ones because I only had to choose once on the shorter game. 4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?I was awake and alert the whole time but the only thing bothering me was m eyes getting a little watery from staring at the screen for a longer period of time.5. Were you distracted at all during the task?Not that I could remember I was pretty focused on the task.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?No I have not. Just a glass of water this morning before I left for school.7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?Yes I do. I play Gears of War, Call of Duty, and Battlefield 4. I donâ€™t play very often. At the most only a few hours a week depending on how busy I was with school work.******************************************************************************************
