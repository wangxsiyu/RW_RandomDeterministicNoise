PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I thought the experiment was about having to make a strategy to accumulate the most points. I thought it was difficult to form a pattern for which lever would have a higher value because you couldn’t see what number was under neath the lever you didn’t choose. 2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  I felt that I formed some sort of a strategy but I don’t know if it was efficient because I don’t have other scores/times to compare it to but overall I felt I did ok. 3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision?  I usually picked to lever that had higher numbers overall. Throughout the 10 trials on each game I would try the opposite lever to see if the number on the other side was higher, if it was then I’d switch to that side. Overall, I tried not to go with a number that was lower than 50 if I had a choice.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games? No, not really. Expect I had less chances to see if the side I wasn’t picking was higher.4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?
	Yes5. Were you distracted at all during the task?
	Slightly, I got a little bored.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?
	None7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?	Yes, I don’t play a lot during the semester but during school breaks I play about 20-40 hours in a week. I like to play RPG, Open map, strategy, fighting, first/third person shooters, point and click, etc. I enjoy pretty much all types of video games.******************************************************************************************
