PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

****************************************************************************************

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I think the experiment was about reaction time and rewarding in your brain. I think it was interesting how I felt better about my game talent when a larger number would appear. 2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  I think it was pretty easy because it was all about taking the average of each side and picking the larger one.3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? Yes, I would take the average of each side and then whichever had the larger average or larger numbers in general is the side i would choose.    (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games?No, for the most part i had the same strategy. 4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?My eyes started to water during the middle of the game because i was so focused on winning and and some points it was hard for me to concentrate.5. Were you distracted at all during the task?Yes, one or two times i would just pick a side that i wasnâ€™t even paying attention to.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?i had a cup of coffee this morning at 9am7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often? rarely ever play video games. ******************************************************************************************
