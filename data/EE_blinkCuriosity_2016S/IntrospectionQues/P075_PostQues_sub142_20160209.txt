PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I think it was about focusing on the eye movements and seeing how the eye adjusts to the color and simple judgements. 2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  It was confusing at first, however, as the game went on it became more easy to understand what was required.	3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? No not necessarily, I kinda just went with the flow and based my last decision on the last box.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games?I think it was different more for the longer games than they were for the short games, only because the longer games consisted of more boxes and more numbers. 4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?Yes. Especially during the part of the experiment where you had to stare at the screen for a total of five minutes. I wanted to go to sleep considering the amount of sleep I received the night before. 5. Were you distracted at all during the task?Yes. For some reason my eyes wanted to look everywhere else besides at the screen. I got fidgety half way through the experiment.6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?The last time I recall having caffeine was this weekend and it was just inside of my coffee. 7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?I play some. On the game systems as well as my phone. The games on my phone I play a little more frequently and theyâ€™re always games like: Candy Crush, 2048, or Solitaire.******************************************************************************************
