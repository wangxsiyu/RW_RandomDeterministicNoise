PLEASE answer the following questions as thoroughly and accurately as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the experimenter.

****************************************************************************************

1. What did you think the experiment was about? Did you have any thoughts (general impressions) about the experiment while you were doing it?I think this experiment was about how someone’s mind will try to make up patterns to make sense of what to do and what the best choice would be.2. Your task was to maximize the number of points earned over the whole game. How easy was this for you?  Overall, I would say it was pretty difficult because I my gut told me to pick one box while my mind was trying to reason and pick the other one.3. (1) Did you have a strategy that you used when making your decision? What I did to make my decisions was look at the value of the numbers that had already appeared, and pick the side that had overall larger numbers. If the numbers appeared around the same, I would pick the side that had to one number that was largest of both of the bandits. Another strategy was that is a column had a relatively large number, I would continuously pick that side unless there was a drastic drop off in the numbers.   (2) Was your strategy different for longer games than shorter games? I used the same stately for both games4. Did you have any trouble staying awake and alert the whole time?Yes, I caught myself at one point just hitting the right bandit key when there was the option to pick what side I wanted.5. Were you distracted at all during the task?

Yes, at when the first participant left, I felt as if I had fallen behind and tried to “catch up”/6. Have you had any caffeine recently? If so, what was it, and when?No7. Do you play video games? If so, what type, and how often?Yes, I like to play all kinds of video games, but mostly sports, RPGs and the occasional shooter. I usually play maybe 3-5 hours a week, depending on my work load.******************************************************************************************
